<div class="post">
<p>I got to spend 8 days in San Francisco in May as part of CiscoLive! (Exclamation is part of the show name, not just me being enthusiastic.)  Although it was for work, I visited a couple of great spots that I wanted to write down.  But, I also figured I’d add a few other notable places that I’ve enjoyed over the years visiting SF.  Hopefully this list can be useful for other folks heading to SF!</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.hopwaterdistribution.com/">Hopwater Distribution</a>  Great atmosphere and 30-ish California beers on tap.</li>
  <li><a href="www.zushipuzzle.com/">Zushi Puzzle</a> Excellent sushi – I think they specialize in Salmon somewhat.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.hotelvitale.com/">Hotel Vitale</a> Stayed here in the past.  Awsome location and spa.</li>
  <li><a href="http://toscacafesf.com/">Tosca Cafe</a> Old-school feel bar.  I’ve heard the Italian food is excellent.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">SF MOMA</a> Modern art.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.laboulangebakery.com/">La Boulange</a> All over the place in SF, but a nice spot to pop into for an early breakfast or easy lunch.</li>
  <li><a href="http://rnglounge.com/">R&amp;G Lounge</a> Haven’t been here myself, but have been told that it’s a solid Chinese place in Chinatown.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.grantplaza.com/">Grant Plaza Hotel</a>  Haven’t stayed here myself, but great bargain in SF according to friends who have stayed there.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.calacademy.org/">California Science Academy</a> Interesting museum that takes you through many biospheres all in one building.  Tasty cafeteria as well!</li>
  <li><a href="http://hogislandoysters.com/">Hog Island Oyster</a> Grab some bubbly and an order of oysters.</li>
  <li><a href="http://tomalesbayoysters.com/">Tomales Bay Oyster Company</a> Has been recommended to me, but haven’t had the chance to try it out.  I hear you can grab a beer and shuck oysters on the beach.  Seems that Hog Island also has a similar concept going on nearby a mile up the road.</li>
</ul>
