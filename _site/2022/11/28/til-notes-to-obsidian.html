<p class="meta">28 Nov 2022</p>

<div class="post">
<p>After reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33754701">this response to a Hacker News post</a>, I was curious about this Zettelkasten concept. In turn, I purchased the “How to Take Smart Notes” book.</p>

<p>As someone who’s liked the idea of having text-based note taking – I’m even writing this in markdown – I’ve tried various tools for Markdown-based note-taking. Eventually I gave up and moved everything to Apple Notes because it just seemed much easier to stay in the flow.</p>

<p>Well, now I’m back to scratching my text-based note taking to try out Obsidian. That meant I had to export out all of my old notes. Hello to <a href="http://falcon.star-lord.me/exporter/">Exporter</a>. While somewhat incomplete – it doesn’t move over screenshots – it does the main job of getting the text moved into Markdown.</p>

<p>TIL: If you need to export Apple Notes to Markdown, try out Exporter!</p>
