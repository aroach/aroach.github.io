title: San Francisco May 2014
---

I got to spend 8 days in San Francisco in May as part of CiscoLive! (Exclamation is part of the show name, not just me being enthusiastic.)  Although it was for work, I visited a couple of great spots that I wanted to write down.  But, I also figured I'd add a few other notable places that I've enjoyed over the years visiting SF.  Hopefully this list can be useful for other folks heading to SF!

* [Hopwater Distribution](http://www.hopwaterdistribution.com/)  Great atmosphere and 30-ish California beers on tap.
* [Zushi Puzzle](www.zushipuzzle.com/) Excellent sushi -- I think they specialize in Salmon somewhat.
* [Hotel Vitale](http://www.hotelvitale.com/) Stayed here in the past.  Awsome location and spa.
* [Tosca Cafe](http://toscacafesf.com/) Old-school feel bar.  I've heard the Italian food is excellent.
* [SF MOMA](http://www.sfmoma.org/) Modern art.
* [La Boulange](http://www.laboulangebakery.com/) All over the place in SF, but a nice spot to pop into for an early breakfast or easy lunch.
* [R&G Lounge](http://rnglounge.com/) Haven't been here myself, but have been told that it's a solid Chinese place in Chinatown.
* [Grant Plaza Hotel](http://www.grantplaza.com/)  Haven't stayed here myself, but great bargain in SF according to friends who have stayed there.
* [California Science Academy](http://www.calacademy.org/) Interesting museum that takes you through many biospheres all in one building.  Tasty cafeteria as well!
* [Hog Island Oyster](http://hogislandoysters.com/) Grab some bubbly and an order of oysters.
* [Tomales Bay Oyster Company](http://tomalesbayoysters.com/) Has been recommended to me, but haven't had the chance to try it out.  I hear you can grab a beer and shuck oysters on the beach.
