Breathing in a savory broth combining onion, mushroom, pepper, ginger. Peeking under the layer of green vegetables, the pan-roasted tomatoes, and silken tofu. Why are some ramens served with straight noodles, and others served with crinkly noodles?

TIL and [Kenji to the rescue](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-serious-eats-guide-to-ramen-styles#toc-what-type-of-noodles-are-ramen)... "You'll typically see thin, straight noodles paired with hearty tonkotsu-style broths, while wavy noodles tend to be paired with miso-flavored ramens. Shio and shoyu-flavored lighter soups can get any type of noodle and the selection varies widely by region."
