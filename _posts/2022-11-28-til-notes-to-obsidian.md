title: TIL Moving Notes to Obsidian
---

After reading [this response to a Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33754701), I was curious about this Zettelkasten concept. In turn, I purchased the "How to Take Smart Notes" book.

As someone who's liked the idea of having text-based note taking -- I'm even writing this in markdown -- I've tried various tools for Markdown-based note-taking. Eventually I gave up and moved everything to Apple Notes because it just seemed much easier to stay in the flow. 

Well, now I'm back to scratching my text-based note taking to try out Obsidian. That meant I had to export out all of my old notes. Hello to [Exporter](http://falcon.star-lord.me/exporter/). While somewhat incomplete -- it doesn't move over screenshots -- it does the main job of getting the text moved into Markdown.

TIL: If you need to export Apple Notes to Markdown, try out Exporter!
