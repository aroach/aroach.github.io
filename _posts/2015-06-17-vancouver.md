I recently traveled to Vancouver, and have a few recommendations on places to go and eat.

## Restaurants
* [Burdock & Co](http://burdockandco.com/) Fairly high end, creative farm-to-table style restaurant.
* [Forage](http://www.foragevancouver.com/) High end, farm-to-table style restaurant.
* [Hokkaido Ramen Santouka](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-vancouver) Awesome ramen place.  No reservations, if you don't get there early, you'll get to wait in line -- which moved quickly.

## Sightseeing
* Stanley Park is really beautiful and accessible from downtown Vancouver.
* Near Stanley Park are water plane aerial tours.
